Robert Gordon and Russell Coke present: InVaDeRs

This game is based on the lab we did in class with a few adjustments, most notably the addition of online multiplayer.
Players will control a spaceship and blow up approaching asteroids to accumulate points.
Each player starts at the same time and receives the same asteroids on their screen in order to make the game fair.
The player with the most points after you have both died wins.

This game is written in python and uses the pygame module along with the socket and _thread module to allow server interaction.
In order for game to run a few things need to be done:

First, two computers are needed to play this game, one computer will run both the invaders.py and
server/echoserver.py file. Before the person who is not going to run the server file runs invaders.py,
in line 207 add the IP address of the host as a string in the first parameter.

Second, the sound functions in pygame gave me an error when I first tried it. I suspect the same thing will happen to you.
This is because a library needed for the sound is either outdated or not included in pygame. Run brew tap homebrew/headonly
then brew install --HEAD smpeg. If that doesn't work run brew update.

Third, if the game crashes without giving any error or just freezes on a white screen, that means some library to display the images
is missing. Run brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf portmidi and it should work.

Enjoy the game, we aren't server experts or anything but we tried :)
